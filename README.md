# recursion-sampler
This is a small repo showing a few recursive algorithms and how applying a trampoline can make it so that they will never cause a Stack Overflow Error. This repo includes implementations for:
* Trampoline
* Memoize
* Factorial
* Reverse String
As well as tests for each function.

## Running the tests
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run test`
